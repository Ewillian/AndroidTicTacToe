## Objective

Make a functional Tic Tac Toe Game on Android Studio.



## How it works

Like any other tic tac toe, we make an ArrayList of buttons and check their content using this pattern:

``````
[0][0] [0][1] [0][2]
[1][0] [1][1] [1][2]
[2][0] [2][1] [2][2]
``````

Each `[] []` is a button (or coordinates) and we check the conditions of victory.



## How to install

Download apk-release from `/app/release` on your phone and install it.
