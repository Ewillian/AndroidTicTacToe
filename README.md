## Objective

Make an functional Tic Tac Toe Game on Android Studio.



## How it works

Like any basically tic tac toe, we makes an arrayList of buttons and we check their contents using this schema :

``````
[0][0] [0][1] [0][2]
[1][0] [1][1] [1][2]
[2][0] [2][1] [2][2]
``````

Each `[] []` is a button (or coordinates of them) and we check the conditions of victory.
